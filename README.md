# CSV-Comparison
This program is capable of comparing two CSV files on a specific column such as an id column and creating an output file of the differences between them. 
The output file will appear in the same folder that the project is in. Please note that this program is only intended for the comparison of CSV files to
other CSV files. However, there is an option to create your output file as a excel file or csv file.
